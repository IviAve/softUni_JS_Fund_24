// Every gamer knows what rage-quitting means. It's basically when you're just not good
// enough and you blame everybody else for losing a game. You press the CAPS LOCK key on
//  the keyboard and flood the chat with gibberish to show your frustration.
// Chochko is a gamer and a bad one at that. He asks for your help; he wants to be
// the most annoying kid on his team, so when he rage-quits he wants something truly spectacular.
//  He'll give you a series of strings followed by non-negative numbers, e.g. "a3"; you need
//  to print on the console each string repeated N times; convert the letters to uppercase beforehand.
//  In the example, you need to write back "AAA".
// On the output, print first a statistic of the number of unique
//  symbols used (the casing of letters is irrelevant, meaning that 'a' and 'A' are the same);
//  the format should be "Unique symbols used {0}". Then, print the rage message itself.
// The strings and numbers will not be separated by anything. The input will always start with
//  a string and for each string, there will be a corresponding number. The entire input will be
//   given on a single line; Chochko is too lazy to make your job easier.
// Input
// •	The input data should be read from the console.
// •	It consists of a single line holding a series of string-number sequences.
// •	The input data will always be valid and in the format described.
// There is no need to check it explicitly.
// Output
// •	The output should be printed on the console. It should consist of exactly two lines.
// •	On the first line, print the number of unique symbols used in the message.
// •	On the second line, print the resulting rage message itself.
// Constraints
// •	The count of string-number pairs will be in the range [1 … 20 000].
// •	Each string will contain any character except digits. The length of each
//  string will be in the range [1 … 20].
// •	The repeat count for each string will be an integer in the range [0 … 20].
// •	Allowed working time for your program: 0.3 seconds. Allowed memory: 64 MB.
